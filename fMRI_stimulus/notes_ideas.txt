notes & ideas

next:
	- image above slider?
	- participant recruitment SONA
	- fMRI pulse function for psych toolbox
	- scan participant signed forms

Apparently had a problem with 
/Applications/MATLAB_R2016b.app/bin/maci64/libfreetype.6.dylib

which I didn't actually change, I just commented out the specification that it was Ariel in my script and everything worked out fine


Should have different shapes for each session, with social(nonsocial) always filled(empty) or vice-versa. This means that if we have 4 sessions (2 social and 2 nonsocial), with 3 opponents in each, then we'll need to have 12 shapes, always randomized, with filled and empty representing social and non-social counter-balanced.

1)  square
2)  circle
3)  triangle
4)  star
5)  diamond
	6)  clover
	7)  pentagon
8)  inverted trapazoid
	9)  semi-circle
	10) crescent
	11) pie (3/4 circle)
	12) helix
	13) weird tetris F
	14) weird tetris N 


Have several conditions specified with switch statements that choose either filled or frame from the images folder for social or nonsocial, respectively, and then randomly assign 3 of each of them to each session.
