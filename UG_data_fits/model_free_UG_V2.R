# for some model free exploring
# this is the second and more correct version of this script
# with better models. 
# It's importat to not here that the first part of this script is data shaping,
# and that I'm planning to add something akin to this in the matlab script 
# that originally shapes this stuff, which will make the first portion of this script
# obsolete. However, the lme4 models are the meat of this script, and that's
# what I use for the results shown in the summary powerpoint.

## What this seems like is that the social effect is in the opposite direction that
## i predicted, but probably for different reasons, I don't think that the fairness
## norm is impeding learning, I think that people are actually learning better in
## the social explicit condition becaus they think that they are playing aginst 
## indivioduals who are using the fairness norm and are more predictable. 
## Perhaps if we hadn't used terminlogy like "lottery" in the instructions we
## would not have this effect, becuase I suspect that people suspect that the 
## computers are simply less predictable than humans or something to that effect.
## If that's the case, then we need to rethink some things, but I need to plot this 
## stuff out first, I think that the tail ends of these opp_trials are quite
## noisy and may have to be taken out.
